## üìã Projec### ü§ñ Machine Learning Implementation Overview

This project was developed as the final assignment for the **Celebal Technologies Summer Internship Programme 2025**. It implements an advanced solution for plant disease classification using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. The model classifies apple leaf images into four distinct categories based on their health conditions, using transfer learning with a fine-tuned ResNet50 architecture.

### üéØ Project Assignment & Objectives

**Original Assignment:**
> "Aim to classify images into multiple categories, such as identifying different species of plants or animals, using traditional machine learning techniques rather than transfer learning. We will extract handcrafted features from the images and train machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines, to perform the classification task."

**Extended Objectives:**
- Implement traditional machine learning approaches with handcrafted features (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Develop a more advanced deep learning model (ResNet50) to compare performance
- Extract and analyze meaningful features from plant disease images
- Explore data augmentation strategies to improve model generalization
- Provide comprehensive comparison between traditional and deep learning approaches

### üçé Disease Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| üå± **Healthy** | Normal leaves without any disease |
| ü¶† **Multiple Diseases** | Leaves showing symptoms of multiple infections |
| üî∂ **Rust** | Leaves with rust disease (orange/brown spots) |
| üî¥ **Scab** | Leaves with scab disease (dark lesions) |

## üî¨ Dataset Analysis

The dataset comprises high-resolution images of apple leaves in various health conditions. Before developing the model, we conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis:

### üìä Class Distribution

- **Healthy**: ~24% of the training dataset
- **Multiple Diseases**: ~16% of the training dataset
- **Rust**: ~28% of the training dataset
- **Scab**: ~32% of the training dataset

*Note: The dataset shows slight class imbalance, which we address through class weighting in the model.*

### üì∏ Image Properties

- **Resolution**: Most images are approximately 2000x2000 pixels
- **Color Space**: RGB images with consistent lighting conditions
- **Aspect Ratio**: Predominantly 1:1 (square images)
- **Format**: JPEG images with good quality and detail

    glcm = graycomatrix(gray, [5], [0, np.pi/4, np.pi/2, 3*np.pi/4])
    stats = ['contrast', 'dissimilarity', 'homogeneity', 'energy', 'correlation']
    
    for stat in stats:
        features.extend(graycoprops(glcm, stat).flatten())
    
    # Shape features - Hu Moments
    moments = cv2.moments(gray)
    hu_moments = cv2.HuMoments(moments)
    features.extend(hu_moments.flatten())
    
    # HOG features for shape and texture
    resized = cv2.resize(gray, (128, 128))
    hog_features = hog(resized, orientations=9, pixels_per_cell=(8, 8),
                       cells_per_block=(2, 2), visualize=False)
